## üíå Origin

I have always been envious of the dynamic calendar icon in Wolai, but unfortunately, there are no related widgets in Obsidian. With the help of GPT, I developed a countdown widget.

Due to my weak front-end skills and lack of familiarity with Obsidian's API calls, I managed to piece things together successfully, and I have to admit, I am quite impressed with myself.

## üêØ Main Features

* Supports specifying a date for dynamic countdown and count-up calculations, relies on JavaScript code, does not depend on the network, and allows adding specific event names.
  
  * If the specified date is earlier than today's date, it counts up.
  * If the specified date is later than today's date, it counts down.
* Supports setting background color for some beautification.
* Configuration supports automatic saving to block attributes in Obsidian, ensuring permanent retention in notes.
* Supports exporting templates for loading configurations, facilitating repeated calls for specific countdown/count-up dates.

## üêõ Known Issues

* The text is designed to be relatively large, so the widget block is not suitable if resized too small.
* The Color Picker for setting colors does not support pasting colors.
* To ensure that the widget and template can be saved and read block attributes correctly during the initial load, a delay of 500ms is added, resulting in slower display.
